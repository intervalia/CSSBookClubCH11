# CSS Book Club - Chapter 11 Demo Files

The file `table.html` shows the various options of using CSS in tables.

The file `non-table.html` shows how to use `<div>`s and CSS to emulate a table and how to make it not a table.

### Clicking

You can click on the various cells and then set properties for that cell by using the sliders or entering a CSS background color.

If you click on a cell labeled `ROW` then the entire row is selected (the `<tr>` tag)

If you click on a cell labeled 'COL` then the entire column is selected (the `<col>` tag)

The three buttons at the top allow you to select the entire `<table>`, the `<thead>` and the `<tbody>`

The `<select>` at the bottom of the page allows you to apply one of a number of style sheets to the table.
